# First of all, thank you!
I want to thank you for stopping by and helping me learn.

I am in love with what I am learning and want to better myself _with your help_.

## Why?
The objective of this repo is for me to make my first running application visible to the public for feedback.

I am building this based on what I have learned so far by consuming tutorials and online courses. I would love for people to let me know what I am doing wrong or how I can do it better.

## How?
I think the best way is to create an issue on whatever you see wrong or any questions you may have on how I did something.

If there are better ways to do this, I am open for suggestions.



# Project Layout
Here is my logic on how this project is layed out.

## /routes
This is where all my routes are. There isn't much going on here. They basically call functions in the /controllers folder.

## /controllers
This is a place to take the request, pull any info from it if needed, respond to requests and etc.

## /services
All business logic here, this is where the meat of the API will be. Gets data from databases and external sources if needed. 

## /db
I assume this will be models but I am still learning and a bit confused on this part. I called it DB because I don't think I am using any models yet and it didn't seem fitting. I am currently using a query building to get data from DB and pass back to the service (i.e. user service).

_If you need more information or if I am not making something clear, please let me know!_

_Looking forward to hearing from you soon!_
