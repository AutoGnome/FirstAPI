# First of all, thank you!
I want to thank you for stopping by and helping me learn.

I am in love with what I am learning and want to better myself _with your help_.

## Why?
The objective of this repo is for me to make my first running application visible to the public for feedback.

I am building this based on what I have learned so far by consuming tutorials and online courses. I would love for people to let me know what I am doing wrong or how I can do it better.

## How?
I think the best way is to create an issue on whatever you see wrong or any questions you may have on how I did something.

If there are better ways to do this, I am open for suggestions.



# Project Layout
I significantly changed the structure of this app due to suggestions made on v1.

The app is now broken up by feature.

Each feature folder has the following files:

## Handler (i.e. productHandler.js)
This is where the request is processed. Not a lot of logic here.

## Service (i.e. productService.js)
Most of the logic for the app is here.

## Queries (i.e. productQueries.js)
All queries go here.

_If you need more information or if I am not making something clear, please let me know!_

_Looking forward to hearing from you soon!_
