# First of all, thank you!
I want to thank you for stopping by and helping me learn.

I am in love with what I am learning and want to better myself _with your help_.

# Why?
The objective of this repo is for me to make my first running application visible to the public for feedback.

I am building this based on what I have learned so far by consuming tutorials and online courses. I would love for people to let me know what I am doing wrong or how I can do it better.

# How?
I think the best way is to create an issue on whatever you see wrong or any questions you may have on how I did something.

If there are better ways to do this, I am open for suggestions.

_Looking forward to hearing from you soon!_
